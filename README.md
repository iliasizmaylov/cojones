# CojoNES - A cycle-inaccurate NES emulator

This project is still a work in progress.

However, when it's finished it is supposed to be a simple yet working
NES emulator that will probably not support all the available mappers
because I don't have time to implement them all.

This project serves as a proof of work for my **[six502 library](https://github.com/iliasizmaylov/six502)** - a library
that provides an interface to build 6502 processor based systems emulation.
